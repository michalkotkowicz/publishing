# Publishing Workflow

Let's make our work public to share it with the world. Use this power wisely and **within legal laws & regulations** (no hate, no bullying, misinformation etc.).

We will use Github's service **Github pages** to publish content of repositories to a publicly accessible URL in the shape of https://accountname.github.io/repositoryname/. 


## Prerequisites
Make sure that you have admin access to this repository. This is needed in order for you to enable GitHub pages.
## Instructions

1. Enable GitHub Pages for this repository.
    * See the settings tab of your repository, on the left navigate to the sub menu **Pages**
    * Github will show the URL of your public page on top of the Source section. It will look like https://youraccount.github.io/repositoryname/
2. Create an `index.html` file as a starting point and fill it with some boilerplate code (e.g. a document title and a first level heading `<h1>Hello public world</h1>`)
3. Visit the public URL (like https://youraccount.github.io/repositoryname/) and check if everything works like it should.
